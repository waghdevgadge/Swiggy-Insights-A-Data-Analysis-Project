# Swiggy-Insights-A-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, I created a comprehensive dashboard showcasing Swiggy's key performance indicators using publicly available data. With Power BI, I visualized metrics such as revenue, number of restaurants, average price, delivery time, and ratings. The dashboard highlights top-performing areas, cities, and food types, providing actionable insights for business growth. Although the data may contain inaccuracies, this project demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful patterns and trends from data. I'm excited to share this project and explore more opportunities in data analysis and visualization.
